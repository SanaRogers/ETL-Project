# ETL-Project

We found data on kaggle on NBA players for Season 2017 - 2018.  We wanted to combine three databases that included the Players' respective Team, PER (Player Efficiency Rating), Draft information and Salary.  

We started by importing and cleaning this data in Pandas.  After we were satisfied with the final data we wanted to use, we linked to Postgres and continued to work there to merge the three tables togeether.
